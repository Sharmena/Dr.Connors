               <p>Scarlet was another lizard I bought from the same pet store at the same time as Dr. Connors. They grew up together and I eventually married them so they become lizard and wife. They had many clutches of children together including a few successful hatchlings! They were quite happy together and although many pet owners will suggest keeping your lizards seperated, I believe it was a happy mistake that lead to thier children. Unofortunately, the babies can't be kept with thier parents, but I sold them to the local pet store who were able to find them good homes.</p>

                   <h3>Metabolic Bones Disease</h3>
               <p> Scarlet was sick shortly after we got her from the pet store (which we beleive was their fault not ours). She stopped eating and we had to force feed her baby food. She lost a lot of weight and because of how young she was, her bones did not have enough calcium to grow properly. Although she couldn't walk properly, she still lived a full life and it led to fun pictures like the one above. Sometimes she would get stuck upsideown when she was pregnant, but she still had many clutches usually ranging from 10-14 eggs. The children did not have this disease as it was not hereditary. Scarlet passed away my sophomore year of high school, likely due to these complications, but lived a full 6 years.</p>
