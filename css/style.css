A CSS rule set has one part called selector, and the other part called declaration. The
declaration contains various rules, each composed by a property, and a value.
In this example, p is the selector, and applies one rule which sets the value 20px to the
font-size property: In this example the body is the selector
and there are a set of rules for: font, padding, margin, and background-color
