                        <h3>Opening his mouth</h3>
                        <p> Lizards can't sweat or maintain their temperature at all so sometimes to let our heat they open their mouth a bit! Doctor Connors sometimes does this when I take him out of his tank so I believe it could mean something else too. I like to think he's smiling at me. Other times, I would put food in his mouth while it was open in hopes he wouldn't spit it out. Sometimes it worked, but for a while he just wouldn't open his mouth in front of me.</p>

                        <h3>Head bobbing</h3>
                        <p> Male lizards will frequently head bob at other people/things and sometimes run towards them. When another female is around, this can be a sign of trying to gain or maintain dominance. The female can accept by waving thier arm in the air. Sometimes a human head bobbing (even just to music) can cause the lizard to head bob back in response to the "challenge." Dr. Connors only did this behavior when Scarlet was around.</p>

                        <h3>Puffing up</h3>
                        <p>A bearded dragon can puff up its body and its beard for multiiple reasons. Sometimes this can be just to stretch, especially when trying to ge off skin that it is shedding. Other times, when the lizard is startled it can puff up its beard and body in attempts to look more intimidating to a potential predetor. Doctor Connors does this frequently when outside the house because the bird easily scare him. Lastly, they sometimes puff up their body when in water so that they can float and then swim along.</p>

                        <h4>Color changes</h4>
                        <p>A bearded dragons colors can change from lighter to darker depedning on their mood and activities. Doctor Connors tends to be brighter when he is happier and more awake, but tends to be darker when I make him take a bath or when he has been sleeping for a while. He also used to just change his beard to a black color when interacting with Scarlet or sometimes just when angry.</p>
