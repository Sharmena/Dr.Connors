                <p> Dr. Connors is the lizard I got in 5th grade. He is a bearded dragon meaning he tends to live in the desert, but instead resides in my home. Here you can learn more about bearded dragons in general, their behaviors and more about Dr. Connors in general.</p>

                <h3>Habitat</h3>
                <p>Like I said, bearded dragons live in the desert. To bring this to my home, I usually put him on crushed walnut shell sand (walnut shell is less harmful if he swallows it than actual sand) and soemtimes put colored sand on top like in the image. I give him multiple places to hide and dig around like drfitwood, plants, or other objects, along with a big water bowl and food dish. </p>

                <h3>Diet</h3>
                <p>Beardies are omnivores that eat a variety of insects, fruits, and vegetables. A healthy diet for these lizards can be a combination of berries, peas and carrots, kale, mealworms, and crickets. Dr. Connors is old and cranky so he more or less only eats mealworms now, but didn't always. </p>

                <h3>Lifetime</h3>
                <p>Dr. Connors is currently about 10 years old! These lizards generally live 10 - 15 years, but the oldest one was 18. </p>
